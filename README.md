# Single-Cycle-MIPS-Processor
Using Verilog (simulated and synthesized using Vivado).

The architecture consists of four main blocks: 

  ➢ Data Memory. 
  
  ➢ Instruction Memory.
  
  ➢ Data Path.
  
  ➢ Control Unit.
  

# Results: By testing the designed processor by two different programs.

1)  Program 1 GCD of 120 and 180 

2)  Program 2 Factorial Number of 7
