# Single-Cycle-MIPS-Processor
Using Verilog (simulated and synthesized using Vivado).

The architecture consists of four main blocks: 

  - Data Memory. 
  
  - Instruction Memory.
  
  - Data Path.
  
  - Control Unit.
  

## Results: By testing the designed processor by two different programs.

- Program 1 GCD of 120 and 180 

- Program 2 Factorial Number of 7
